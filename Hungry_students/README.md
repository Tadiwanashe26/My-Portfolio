# Hungry Student recipe website
#### Video Demo:  [My Video](https://youtu.be/-GWD4AWD-Fg)

## Preface
Before embarking on my project I did a little bit of research into trying to use VScode outside of the cs50 codespace environment which was hectic and did not go according to paln which lead to two wasted weeks trying to install differnt packages and figure out how to use virtual environments. However I discovered tailwind css in this period and it was love at first site(get it).

## Project Organisation
I followed the general organization taught on web applications using flask habving all my templates in the template folder, my static files in the static folder and all my python code for the flask application in the app.py. Additionally I have a database to store user data, and a tailwind configuration  file. Within the static folder there are several subfolders namely:
- dist - stores the output.css generated by tailwind
- img - stores static img files and icons
- img_uploads - stores user uploaded images
- src - stores the input.css file for tailwind

Additonally there are three Javascript files which are named according to thier functionality.

## Description
### layout.html
The provided HTML code outlines the structure of a web page, presumably for most of my website catering to students. It features a standard HTML layout with metadata, including a title and links to external resources. The body section encompasses a navigation bar with options for Home, Submit Recipe, My Recipes, and About sections, along with sign-in and registration links. A main content area is present, for displaying dynamic content. For smaller screens, i have implemented a responsive mobile navigation menu with a burger icon. At the bottom, a footer displays copyright information and a sign-out button for authenticated users. JavaScript scripts are imported for functionality, including custom scripts and the Ionicons library for icon display.  I implemented lots of custom desing in the form of flex boxes and colours to make the webiste visually appealing.

### Login and Registration
The login and registration functionalities of the website provide users with a seamless and secure experience. On the front end, users interact with the forms for inputting their email, password, and confirming their password in the case of registration. These forms are styled using Tailwind. Upon submission, the form data is sent to the backend, where Flask routes handle the logic. For registration, the backend checks for password match and complexity, as well as existing email addresses in the database to prevent duplication. If successful, user data is securely stored in the database, and users are redirected to the login page with informative flash messages indicating successful registration or the respective errors encountered. The login process involves similar validation steps, where user input is compared with stored credentials in the database. If credentials match, users are authenticated and logged in, granting access to protected areas of the website. Both the registration and login functionalities incorporate CSRF protection and password hashing to ensure data integrity and user security throughout the process.

### Index (homepage)
My homepage functionality integrates a Flask route with a JavaScript file (recipeloader.js) to deliver a dynamic and engaging user experience. The Flask route is configured to render the index.html template, serving as the homepage interface for users accessing  the root URL . Upon accessing the homepage, Flask invokes this route, which in turn renders the template and sends it to the user's browser. Concurrently, the recipeloader.js file utilizes asynchronous requests via the Fetch API to fetch recipe data from backend Flask routes (/all_recipes and /latest_recipes). Upon receiving the data, JavaScript dynamically creates recipe card elements, populating them with the database information such as the recipe's image, name, author, and cooking time. Event listeners are added to enable interaction, such as redirecting users to the recipe details page upon clicking a card. The rendered recipe cards are then appended to designated container elements on the homepage, seamlessly integrating backend data retrieval and frontend display to provide users with a dynamic and interactive browsing experience for discovering recipes. within the database the image path is actually stored and this is used tofetch the correct image from the image uploads folder, This implementation was assisted by cs50s Ai tools. The /all_recipes route retrieves all recipes from the database and returns them in JSON format, enabling dynamic loading and display of all available recipes on the homepage. Similarly, the /latest_recipes route fetches the most recent recipes, orders them by ID, and limits the result to the five latest recipes. I did this because of the way I did my griding, only 5 recpies fit in a line.

### Recipe submission
In handling the recipe submission process, the backend validates user inputs meticulously, ensuring all necessary fields are accurately filled and data is properly sanitized for security. I implemented blank defaults for the unity and quantityincase a user submits something that doesn't necessarily need it. For uploaded files, it checks the file extensions using the function allowed files and securely saves images. Interacting with the database, it efficiently stores recipe details alongside related ingredients and instructions. With robust error-handling mechanisms in place, it adeptly manages any potential issues during database transactions, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly submission experience.

### My Recipe
Serves as the dashboard page of the site, rendered via Flask, provides users with a personalized space to manage their recipes. The frontend layout greets users. It dynamically loads the user's submitted recipes, displaying each recipe card with its respective details like name, author, and cooking time. The backend, managed by Flask routes, ensures secure access to the dashboard by verifying user sessions. It retrieves the user's recipes from the database based on their session ID, safeguarding data privacy. In case of any errors or if the user has no recipes, the user is redirected to the submit page and flashed with a message.

### About
Simple about page explain the site to the user.
